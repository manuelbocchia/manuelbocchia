- 👋 Hi, I’m @manuelbocchia
- 👀 I’m interested in videogames, web design, programming... well, music, writing, reading, painting, anything really. Except sports, I guess.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the fundamentals of web developments, I have finished the basics of HTML and CSS and I'm setting up a few projects.
I'm diving deep into JS as well right now, my next step will be to create some cool frontend stuff to settle everything inside, and then I'll go straight
into SQL and databases.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything really. Simple things at the moment, but I have many ideas for the future!
- 📫 How to reach me: you can find me through GitHUB, Linkedin, Instagram... I'm going to set up my links shortly, 
for now you can visit http://linktr.ee/manu.bocchia
