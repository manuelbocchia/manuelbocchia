- 👋 Hi, I’m @manuelbocchia
- 👀 I’m interested in videogames, web design, programming... well, music, writing, reading, painting, anything really. Except sports, I guess.
- 🌱 I’m currently doing the Full Stack Web Development course in the Odin Project. I'm currently learning Ruby. It's quite fun so far.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything really. Simple things at the moment, but I have many ideas for the future!
- 📫 How to reach me: you can find me through GitHUB, Linkedin, Instagram... I'm going to set up my links shortly, 
for now you can visit http://linktr.ee/manu.bocchia
